  abstract = {A discontinuity exists between object-oriented modeling and
             programming languages. This discontinuity arises from ambiguous
             concepts in modeling languages and a lack of corresponding
             concepts in programming languages. It is particularly acute for
             binary class relation\-ships---association, aggregation, and
             composition. It hinders the traceability between software
             implementation and design, thus hampering software analysis. We
             propose consensual definitions of the binary class relationships
             with four minimal properties---exclusivity, invocation site,
             lifetime, multiplicity. We describe algorithms to detect
             automatically the properties in source code and apply these on
             several frameworks. Thus, we bridge the gap between
             implementation and design for the binary class relationships,
             easing software analysis.},
